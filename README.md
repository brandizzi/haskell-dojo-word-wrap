# Haskell Dojo: Word Wrap

This is the result of a coding dojo we took part here at Liferay at Recife. The 
goal was to implement a word-wrapping function as defined in [this code 
kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/WordWrap). We used HSpec for testing. Sadly, 
we forgot to commit each change so here is only the final (incomplete) result 
but it was surely a lot of fun! :smile:

Thanks for @allanragec, @brandizzi, @cleydyr, @feliperp-81, @natocesarrego, 
@ricardofunke, @victorlaerte and @walber (is someone missing?) for the amazing 
event!

(Before the dojo, we used [these 
slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AdamVictorBrandizzi/haskell-76743344) to get 
an overview about Haskell. They are in Brazilian Portuguese, though.)
