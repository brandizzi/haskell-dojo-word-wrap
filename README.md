# Haskell Dojo: Word Wrap

This is the result of a coding dojo we took part here at Liferay at Recife. The 
goal was to implement a word-wrapping function as defined in [this code 
kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/WordWrap). We used HSpec for testing. Sadly, 
we forgot to commit each change so here is only the final (incomplete) result 
but it was surely a lot of fun! :smile:
